This handles the errata for PLL1 and PLL2. This function is called in device startup. 


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em count} & \+: Number of retries until both PLLs are locked successfully Minimum value recommended is 5\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
0 = Success (the PLL or both PLLs have successfully locked and then been disabled) 1 = PLL1 failed to successfully lock in \char`\"{}count\char`\"{} tries 2 = PLL2 failed to successfully lock in \char`\"{}count\char`\"{} tries 3 = Neither PLL1 nor PLL2 successfully locked in \char`\"{}count\char`\"{} tries 4 = The workaround function was not able to disable at least one of the PLLs. The most likely reason is that a PLL is already being used as a clock source. This can be caused by the workaround function being called from the wrong place in the code.
